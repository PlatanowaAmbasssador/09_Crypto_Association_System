# Unsupervised Learning: Crypto Transaction Analysis  

## Overview  

As blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to evolve, the number of cryptocurrency transactions is growing at an incredible pace. With so much activity happening on networks like Ethereum, understanding how tokens interact and identifying transaction patterns can offer valuable insights into market trends, unusual behaviors, and smarter investment strategies.  

This study dives into Ethereum transaction data using the **Etherscan API** to track wallet interactions with various tokens. By capturing details like transaction timestamps, buy/sell activity, and gas fees, we analyze trading behaviors and uncover hidden patterns using **association rule mining** with the **Apriori and Eclat** algorithms.  

## Key Features  

âœ… **Ethereum Transaction Analysis** â€“ Track wallet addresses and token interactions  
âœ… **Association Rule Mining** â€“ Identify frequently associated tokens  
âœ… **Apriori & Eclat Algorithms** â€“ Discover common trading pairs and token correlations  
âœ… **Interactive Visualizations** â€“ Use item frequency plots, network graphs, and more
